        <h2>Traits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The jungle cat is known for having a uniformly sandy, reddish-brown or grey fur without spots; melanistic and albino individuals are also known.
                It is solitary in nature, except during the mating season and mother-kitten families. Adults maintain territories by urine spraying and scent marking.
                Its preferred prey is small mammals and birds. It hunts by stalking its prey, followed by a sprint or a leap; the ears help in pinpointing the location of prey.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The fur of the black-footed cat varies in color from cinnamon-buff to tawny, and is patterned with black or brown spots that merge to form rings on the legs,
                    neck, and tail. These patterns provide the animals with camouflage; the backs of their ears, however, are the same color as the background color of their fur.</li>

                        and cold temperatures. It inhabits both sandy and stony deserts, in areas far from water sources.</li>
